# Embedded Ansible

CloudForms 4.5 (ManageIQ *Fine*) introduced an automation capability
that uses an embedded Ansible automation engine to run Ansible playbooks
as a new type of service. These services can be run interactively, or
from Control events and Alert actions.

> **Note**
> 
> The embedded Ansible capability is also known by its Red Hat marketing
> name of *Ansible Automation Inside*

CloudForms 4.6 (ManageIQ *Gaprindashvili*) has extended the capabilities
of embedded Ansible to allow us to run Ansible playbooks as automation
methods.
