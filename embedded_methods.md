Embedded Methods are a new feature of CloudForms 4.6 (ManageIQ _Gaprindashvili_) that allow for libraries of common Ruby Automate code to be created. These libraries can be embedded in, and invoked from, other Automate methods, promoting code re-use.

This section describes the capabilities of Embedded Methods in CloudForms 4.6 and ManageIQ _Gaprindashvili_.

The section contains 2 chapters:
