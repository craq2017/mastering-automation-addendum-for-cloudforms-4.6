# Embedded Methods

A useful new feature with CloudForms 4.6 (ManageIQ *Gaprindashvili*) is the ability to be able to create reusable libraries of Ruby automation methods, and include (_embed_) these into other Ruby methods to use. This promotes code re-use, makes methods smaller, avoids code duplication, and simplifies testing.



no support for nested embedded methods
