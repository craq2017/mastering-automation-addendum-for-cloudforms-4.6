# Generic Objects

Generic Objects are a very useful new feature of CloudForms 4.6 (ManageIQ *Gaprindashvili*). They allow us to create custom object classes to represent objects that we may work with, but might not necessarily be represented by an out-of-the-box CloudForms / ManageIQ object. An example might be a load balancer, or a firewall rule.
