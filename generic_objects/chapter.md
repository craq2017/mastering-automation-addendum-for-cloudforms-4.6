# Generic Objects

Generic Objects are a very useful new feature of CloudForms 4.6
(ManageIQ *Gaprindashvili*). They allow us to create custom object
classes to represent objects that we may work with, but might not
necessarily be represented by an out-of-the-box CloudForms/ManageIQ
object. An example might be a load balancer, or a firewall rule.
